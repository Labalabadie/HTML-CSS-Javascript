I took it upon my self to keep and keep growing, I followed this tutorial to it's completion in the span of a week or so.
Here I learned very little about computer science and programming logic, but a lot about javascript sintax. 
So, I built some muscle memory by programming 3 small applications, a counter, a simple blackjack game and an chrome extension to save URLs.

Feel free to snoop around and don't forget to practice yourself.
